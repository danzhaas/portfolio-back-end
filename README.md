# portfolio-back-end
Back end for danzhaas.github.io.  Coded with Node.js and Express.  Connects to a MongoDB database.

IMPORTANT NOTE: 
There is one file missing from config/ and it is called default.json.  It is not included here because it contains a username and password, and you don't want that visible to github users.

The following three lines are the entire contents of default.json:
{
    "mongoURI": "< A string containing the connection location which you get from the mongoDB database you create >"
}
